<p>Well, that&#8217;s another silly little side-project in the can. If you&#8217;d like to have Twitter comments on your blog, wiki, website, or basically anything with a URL, head on over to <a href="http://chirrup.angryamoeba.co.uk">http://chirrup.angryamoeba.co.uk</a> and download Chirrup to get started!</p>

<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://www.videojuicer.com">Videojuicer</a> dev team for helping with testing - <a href="http://skein.tumblr.com/">Ted Han</a>, <a href="http://sd2.com/">John Carlin</a>, <a href="http://aelius.net/">Alex Nichol</a> and <a href="http://mochapowered.com/">Adam Livesley</a>. And thanks to Adam for turning Chirrup into a <a href="http://chirrup.angryamoeba.co.uk/docs/wordpress.html">wordpress plugin</a> - this functionality is included in the main <a href="http://chirrup.angryamoeba.co.uk/download.html">download package </a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for bearing with us over the testing period, and have fun with Chirrup!</p>
