title: In which we enjoy catharsis by joining the Merb vs. Rails drama

<p>Summarising this post from <a href="http://merbist.com/2008/11/15/rails-vs-merb-drama/">Merbist</a>, in which the current bun fight between Rails and Merb camps is documented in detail:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Rails</a> is enormous and comes as a package. Although it is theoretically possible to run Rails without some of the bajillion modules it loads at boot, it involves freezing your Rails version, removing a bunch of includes, staying clear of any dependent methods and, oh yeah, never being able to easily upgrade to newer Rails versions again. Ever. </p>

<p><a href="http://merbivore.com/">Merb</a> is smaller, although younger (Rails used to be smallish too), but it has a modular design which allows you to actively decide the size of the included framework. Smaller projects can use only the core controller stack, while larger projects can introduce Merb&#8217;s ORM, view and many helper modules on a selective basis as they are needed. Merb is also faster in most cases (YMMV) and in my own personal experience has a far lower rate of <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m">WTFs/minute</a>  when reading through both core source and addon source, thanks to Merb&#8217;s plugin API.</p>

<p>Merb has taken functional cues from Rails&#8217; brilliant RESTful resource handling and multi-format controller actions, and Rails is taking some architectural cues from Merb&#8217;s super-fast controller stack and non-blocking file uploads. </p>

<p>I have problems with Rails&#8217; lack of modular containment and high-maintenance hackability, but I also see why there&#8217;s room for an end-to-end framework in the marketplace. I have problems with <a href="http://loudthinking.com/">DHH</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/2007/10/10/imploding-rails-jesus-dhh-and-the-uncle-ben-principle/">decision to solicit help from a community he had no intention of listening to</a>, but I also appreciate that strength of ideology is what made Rails take off in the first place. </p>

<p>I just wish Rails didn&#8217;t so finely straddle the line between being &#8220;opinionated&#8221; and being an <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/doesrails/128015501/">irresponsible douche</a>. </p>

<p>In the end, we&#8217;re all trying to solve the same problems. So find the tools you like, help them grow, and have fun hacking. And for science&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t be a douche.</p>
