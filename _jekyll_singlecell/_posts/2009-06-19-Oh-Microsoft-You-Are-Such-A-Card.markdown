- epic NIH syndrome
- many great works, but IE is not one of them
- in fact, MS has never really understood the web
- marketing department may as well be living on the moon
- doesn't compare safari, lol
- dusting off the marketing machine because of EU antitrust ruling (citation needed)
- most worrisome is the notion that each of these features is being measured in a binary fashion
