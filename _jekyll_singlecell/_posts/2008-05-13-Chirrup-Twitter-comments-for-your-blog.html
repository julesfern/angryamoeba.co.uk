title: Chirrup - Twitter comments for your blog!

<p>UPDATE: Chirrup is now available to the public. Visit <a href="http://chirrup.angryamoeba.co.uk"> <a href="http://chirrup.angryamoeba.co.uk">http://chirrup.angryamoeba.co.uk</a></a> to get your copy.</p>

<p>You might&#8217;ve noticed some new features here at Singlecell - we&#8217;ve been working on a library called Chirrup, which allows you to include comments from Twitter in your pages.</p>

<p>The idea behind Chirrup is to provide a more natural relationship between dialogue happening on individual pages and dialogue happening in public on applications such as Twitter. People are discussing content in comment sections, and then duplicating the discussion on Twitter - so why not marry the two up?</p>

<p>When you post a comment to a page via Chirrup, your comment is sent as an @reply to the blog&#8217;s owner, and contains both the URL and your comment. This means that your comments are completely legible to the rest of Twitter, and contain no unnecessary data.</p>

<p>Chirrup&#8217;s server-side component then slurps up the blog owner&#8217;s @replies and sorts through them for Chirrup responses. It supports compression and decompression of tinyurl&#8217;s, so comments sent with all major Twitter clients can be recognised by Chirrup&#8217;s parser.</p>

<p>Chirrup will enjoy a short testing period on this page while I snarf down huge piles of my own dog food, and will then be released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> license.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you find a bug in Chirrup&#8217;s behaviour, I&#8217;d be obliged if you&#8217;d post it to the <a href="http://www.bugtails.com/projects/156/">Chirrup bugtracker</a> on <a href="http://tailshq.com">Tails</a>.</p>
