title: Developers and the Kübler-Ross model

The [Kübler-Ross][wikipedia] model is a classic pattern that defines how people deal with great loss or catastrophe. It's the five-stage grief model so beloved by TV scriptwriters - [an array of shows][tvrefs] have made use of the model, most notably [this brilliant episode of The Simpsons][simpsons] in which Homer learns of his own impending demise:

> Hibbert: There are five stages. First is denial.

> Homer: No way, because I'm not dying.

> Hibbert: Next comes anger.

> Homer: Why you little...

> Hibbert: After that comes fear.

> Homer: What's after fear? What's after fear?

> Hibbert: Bargaining.

> Homer: Doc, you've got to get me out of this. I'll make it worth your while.

> Hibbert: And finally, comes acceptance.

> Homer: Well, we've all got to go sometime.

> Hibbert: Mr. Simpson, your progress is remarkable!
	
It only occurred to me recently that the same model applies to a developer being told that his work has a bug. Not just a simple display bug, but one of those really nasty voodoo buggers that defy all attempts at rational explanation and turn debugging into a two-day stretch of swearing, shouting, and occult sacrifices. Observe:

Denial
------

> Nah, that works just fine. Must be a freak happenstance, or the user's machine is knackered.

Anger
-----

> Why do people bring me all these problems? Give the users better training!

Bargaining
----------

> Maybe we can just fix it in the next version, so I can get on with my life?

Depression
----------

> This problem will never go away. It's going to actually haunt me until I die. I am Moby Dick to this bug's Ahab. 

Acceptance
----------

> If I fix this, I can have my life back.
