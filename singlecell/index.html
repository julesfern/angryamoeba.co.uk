<p>Not enough developers get angry when they encounter the <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1357">password antipattern</a>. You’ll know it when you see it because you’ll see <strong>site A</strong> asking you for your login credentials for <strong>site B</strong> in order to enable <strong>cool feature C</strong>. That <strong>cool feature C</strong> is <em>usually</em> a mechanic for spamming <strong>site A</strong>’s users into signing up for <strong>site B</strong> notwithstanding, this pattern smells worse than week-old crab left wrapped up in some wet newspaper atop a radiator.</p>

<p>Yes. This pattern is terrible for security because the least secure part of any system is inevitably the fallible bipedal meat-creature who uses that system, and a culture that encourages meat-beings to hand over login credentials to any form that winks and offers to buy us a drink will only further damage our already poor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes">intertube</a> survival instincts. Not only is this insecure, but a complete replacement of the concept of <em>authentication</em> by a dangerously brittle system of electronic hearsay.</p>

<p>The point of a framework is to help automate common work, right? So why is building your application’s authentication system so repetetive? The <a href="http://merbivore.com/">Merb</a> framework does a lot of useful things and, thankfully, finally includes core patterns and support for user authentication within the framework. It’s called merb-auth, it just moved into town, and it is already beating up other frameworks and stealing their lunch money. And dating your daughter.</p>

<p>You should use merb-auth because:
</p>
<ul>
<li>It provides a clean, easily-extendable structure for authentication.</li>
<li>It’s part of the official framework, so it’s far less likely to break between versions.</li>
<li>It’s just plain damned sensible when you weigh up what it automates for you.</li>
</ul>

<p>So let’s build a quick merb app to test it with:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">merb-gen app merb-auth-playground
cd merb-auth-playground
merb-gen resource secret
merb-gen resource user</code></pre>

<p>Summarising this post from <a href="http://merbist.com/2008/11/15/rails-vs-merb-drama/">Merbist</a>, in which the current bun fight between Rails and Merb camps is documented in detail:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Rails</a> is enormous and comes as a package. Although it is theoretically possible to run Rails without some of the bajillion modules it loads at boot, it involves freezing your Rails version, removing a bunch of includes, staying clear of any dependent methods and, oh yeah, never being able to easily upgrade to newer Rails versions again. Ever. </p>

<p><a href="http://merbivore.com/">Merb</a> is smaller, although younger (Rails used to be smallish too), but it has a modular design which allows you to actively decide the size of the included framework. Smaller projects can use only the core controller stack, while larger projects can introduce Merb&#8217;s ORM, view and many helper modules on a selective basis as they are needed. Merb is also faster in most cases (YMMV) and in my own personal experience has a far lower rate of <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m">WTFs/minute</a>  when reading through both core source and addon source, thanks to Merb&#8217;s plugin API.</p>

<p>Merb has taken functional cues from Rails&#8217; brilliant RESTful resource handling and multi-format controller actions, and Rails is taking some architectural cues from Merb&#8217;s super-fast controller stack and non-blocking file uploads. </p>

<p>I have problems with Rails&#8217; lack of modular containment and high-maintenance hackability, but I also see why there&#8217;s room for an end-to-end framework in the marketplace. I have problems with <a href="http://loudthinking.com/">DHH</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/2007/10/10/imploding-rails-jesus-dhh-and-the-uncle-ben-principle/">decision to solicit help from a community he had no intention of listening to</a>, but I also appreciate that strength of ideology is what made Rails take off in the first place. </p>

<p>I just wish Rails didn&#8217;t so finely straddle the line between being &#8220;opinionated&#8221; and being an <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/doesrails/128015501/">irresponsible douche</a>. </p>

<p>In the end, we&#8217;re all trying to solve the same problems. So find the tools you like, help them grow, and have fun hacking. And for science&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t be a douche.</p>

<p>The guys and girls over at <a href="http://www.createwithcontext.com/">Create with Context</a> have created a very interesting document detailing the results of their independent user testing of the iPhone, and in a stroke of sheer brilliance they&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.createwithcontext.com/how-people-really-use-the-iphone.html">made it available to all of us</a>.</p>

<p>Their look into usability of the in-built iPhone apps turns up some interesting points about Apple&#8217;s iconography. Many users note confusion around the purpose of some icons, most notably between search and zoom. It seems that some users expect magnifying glass icons to either increase the current zoom level, or to reset the zoom level to a full-page view. This is unfortunate, because the magnifying glass is, on the desktop, the canonical icon for search - so I&#8217;m curious to see if these results are specific to user interfaces that are so centered around zoom and pan, or if we&#8217;ve been missing problems with desktop iconography all along. It&#8217;s also possible that the relatively cramped conditions on the iPhone&#8217;s screen give little opportunity to space controls out and give them distinct context.</p>

<p>Most useful for my fellow Cocoa Touch developers is the section on App Store experiences, which gives insight into app pricing, which App Store listings and the impact of positive/negative reviews on the download page.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.createwithcontext.com/how-people-really-use-the-iphone.html">highly recommended download</a> and I&#8217;d like to thank Create with Context for making it available to all of us.</p>

<p>Basic software security, lesson #1: You are only as secure as the weakest point in your system.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a valuable lesson. Earlier this year Barclays made a big show of security, even going so far as to <a href="http://www.barclays.co.uk/pinsentry/">mail two-factor authentication devices to their customers</a> in an attempt to prevent online banking fraud. That&#8217;s a big investment.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Barclays, it doesn&#8217;t matter, and their money was wasted. Because if you want to compromise the computers of Barclays account holders, there&#8217;s no need to circumvent the giant, thoroughly-audited security schemes that are almost certainly in place. Nope, you just need to compromise their analytics provider.</p>

<img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080828-txecf7ttm1myj9qf2qbssx2kum.jpg" alt="code fail"/><p>That&#8217;s right, every page load from your &#8220;private&#8221;, &#8220;secure&#8221; banking pages is also communicating directly with Webtrends&#8217; servers. And worse, Webtrends get to run code within the page, putting you totally at their mercy. If an angry Webtrends employee wants to harvest your banking data, he needs only change that javascript without alerting Barclays first. If you google &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=webtrendslive">webtrendslive</a>&#8221;, by the way, you&#8217;ll notice that malware reports actually outrank the actual product site. It&#8217;s a nice touch.</p>

Sometimes, you <em>want</em> your code to fail. You want to make sure that in the event of a failure, an exception is generated - the equivalent of a controlled explosion. Something you can design contingencies around. Until now I&#8217;ve been a little frustrated with testing these eventualities, so I decided to hack up a quick custom assertion for your Test::Unit suites (although it should translate pretty effortlessly to RSpec or any other test framework):

<pre class="ruby"><code>
# In test_helper.rb:
def assert_error_raised(errorklass=StandardError, &amp;block)
     raised = false
     begin
       block.call 
     rescue errorklass 
       raised = true
     end
     # You will see this message if an error was not raised.
     # If an error was raised which was not of the type you specified, then the test trace
     # will be allowed to display the error as normal and the test will fail with an E.
     assert raised, "Expected error #{errorklass.to_s} to be raised but error never encountered."
end

# In your application code, let's say some_model.rb:
def do_something_with(array)
       unless array.is_a?(Array)
              raise ArgumentError, "Argument of type #{array.class.to_s} given to SomeModel#do_something when argument must be of type Array"
       end
       continue_doing_something
end

# In your test suite:
def test_error_generated_with_bad_argument_to_do_something_with
       @some_model = SomeModel.new
       # This test will pass
       assert_error_raised(ArgumentError) do
              @some_model.do_something_with "i'm not an array"
       end
       # This test will fail and dump the error via your test console's usual channel
       assert_error_raised(RuntimeError) do
              @some_model.do_something_with "neither am i"
       end
end</code></pre>

<p>Hi there, sorry I haven&#8217;t written in a while. It&#8217;s this damned work business. Some actual content is promised soon.</p>

<p>Anyhow - A rather nasty text-escaping bug popped up in Chirrup, so I&#8217;ve issued a patch in version 0.81 which is <a href="http://chirrup.angryamoeba.co.uk">available for download</a> now.</p>

<p>The problem: Badly-formatted tweets containing certain special characters caused Chirrup&#8217;s JSON to fail parsing and the Chirrup UI to not display.</p>

<p>The fix: Improved sanitisation routine for tweet data being sent over JSON.</p>

<p>Happy Tweeting.</p>

Just documenting this one for later, really. If you&#8217;re setting up a git repository and you need to ignore certain types of file - logs, or python bytecode (not that I&#8217;m dealing with those two problems at this exact moment or anything), the procedure is quite simple:

<pre><code>
# Get to the hidden .git directory within your project.
cd /path/to/your/project
cd .git/info
# in .git/info is a file named "exclude". Open it in whatever you like. Here we'll open it with Textmate.
mate exclude
</code></pre>

The file&#8217;s contents are, by default, commented out. To add your own ignore rules, just add each rule on a new line. Here&#8217;s a simple example from a Python project which prevents bytecode and Textmate project files from being committed:

<pre><code>
*.pyc
*.tmproj
</code></pre>

In a Rails project, you&#8217;d likely want a set of rules like the following <em>completely untested</em> fragment:

<pre><code>
log
*.log
*.pid
tmp
</code></pre>

<p>UPDATE: Chirrup is now available to the public. Visit <a href="http://chirrup.angryamoeba.co.uk">chirrup.angryamoeba.co.uk</a> to get your copy.</p>

<p>You might&#8217;ve noticed some new features here at Singlecell - we&#8217;ve been working on a library called Chirrup, which allows you to include comments from Twitter in your pages.</p>

<p>The idea behind Chirrup is to provide a more natural relationship between dialogue happening on individual pages and dialogue happening in public on applications such as Twitter. People are discussing content in comment sections, and then duplicating the discussion on Twitter - so why not marry the two up?</p>

<p>When you post a comment to a page via Chirrup, your comment is sent as an @reply to the blog&#8217;s owner, and contains both the URL and your comment. This means that your comments are completely legible to the rest of Twitter, and contain no unnecessary data.</p>

<p>Chirrup&#8217;s server-side component then slurps up the blog owner&#8217;s @replies and sorts through them for Chirrup responses. It supports compression and decompression of tinyurl&#8217;s, so comments sent with all major Twitter clients can be recognised by Chirrup&#8217;s parser.</p>

<p>Chirrup will enjoy a short testing period on this page while I snarf down huge piles of my own dog food, and will then be released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> license.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you find a bug in Chirrup&#8217;s behaviour, I&#8217;d be obliged if you&#8217;d post it to the <a href="http://www.bugtails.com/projects/156/">Chirrup bugtracker</a> on <a href="http://tailshq.com">Tails</a>.</p>
