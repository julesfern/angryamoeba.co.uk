<p>I recently gave a presentation to my colleagues at <a href='http://videojuicer.com'>Videojuicer</a> about HTML5 and what it means for our business and our technology roadmap. Being a mindless sheep, I did of course opt to create the presentation itself in HTML5 with the intention of having the audience follow along in their browsers, without the aid of a projector.</p>

<p>Then, a thought occurred.</p>

<p><em>If I&#8217;m putting a slide deck on screens that are owned by the audience, then the audience should get some control of their own.</em></p>

<p>Using this principle as a guide, I hacked up a quick <a href='http://nodejs.org'>Node.js</a> and <a href='http://socket.io'>Socket.io</a> demo that would allow audience members to either sit back and follow the presentation as I moved through the slides, or to break off from the flow and browse the deck themselves, rejoining the rest of the audience whenever they choose.</p>

<p>The presentation was a success, and I was struck by the creative potential of allowing audience members their own runtime instance of a slide deck. What&#8217;s possible with this setup that isn&#8217;t possible with a regular Keynote presentation? Including hyperlinks for audiences to follow for further reading is basic. We can do more:</p>

<ul>
<li>Include interactive elements in slides. Navigable data visualisations, canvas objects, tech demos, whatever.</li>

<li>Use selective disclosure to keep slides brief but allow individual audience members to drill down on items they find interesting.</li>

<li>Allow audiences to simply save your presentation out of their browsers.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;ve since cleaned up this presentation engine and released it under the name <a href='http://github.com/danski/squeenote'>Squeenote</a>. Authoring presentations for Squeenote is ridiculously simple; a presentation is simply an HTML file containing an ordered list of slides. See the <a href='http://github.com/danski/Squeenote/blob/master/readme.mdown'>README</a> for more information. Here&#8217;s the initial feature list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Presenter follow/unfollow for audience members</li>

<li>Password-protected presenter mode</li>

<li>Support for HTML5-friendly browsers. Tested in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Mobile Safari.</li>

<li>Themeable. Since a presentation is just an HTML file, a theme is just CSS and/or JS.</li>

<li>Includes a default theme using CSS3 Transitions, with basic iPad and iPhone support for audience members.</li>

<li>Modular and hackable. All components, including the Squeenote UI, are replaceable and extendable.</li>

<li>Designed for archival. A Squeenote presentation can be uploaded to a static web server without the Node.js component and it will run in &#8220;presenter offline&#8221; mode.</li>
</ul>
