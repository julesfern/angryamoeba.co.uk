				<p><a href='http://www.kk.org'>Kevin Kelly</a>, of <em>Wired</em> fame, has launched a lovely collaborative project to map the Internet, sensibly named <a href='http://www.kk.org/internet-mapping/'>The Internet Mapping Project</a>.</p>

<p>The goal is for individuals to try and map the hairy N-dimensional structure of the Internet into a two-dimensional representation that matches their own interpretation of it, but the interesting twist is that contributors are expected to place their &#8216;home&#8217; on the map. The split in designs is interesting - some contributors have drawn the internet from a <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinkelly/3585540367/in/set-72157613562011932/'>position of consumption</a>, placing their home at the center of a network of services, while others have drawn their maps from a <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinkelly/3390479096/in/set-72157613562011932/'>position of oversight</a>, trying to make sense of the many brands and roles that dominate our lives online.</p>

<p>I decided to try my hand at contributing myself, so I spent an hour this morning with a biro trying to make sense of the thing. I wanted to illustrate the difference and interdependence between things online that are predetermined, and things online that <em>just happen</em>. It also amused me to depict &#8216;the bubble&#8217; as a self-contained structure that is completely insulated from outside realities, and in which you are <a href='http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0074812/'>unable to survive past thirty</a>.</p>

<p>What I ended up with is basically a water cycle diagram from year 10 geography class, except I didn&#8217;t colour it in<em>.</em></p>

<p><em>which means I would, under the reign of my former teacher, have lost marks for failing to add artistic flair to what is intended to be a scientific topic.</em></p>
