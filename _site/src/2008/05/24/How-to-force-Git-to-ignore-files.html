Just documenting this one for later, really. If you&#8217;re setting up a git repository and you need to ignore certain types of file - logs, or python bytecode (not that I&#8217;m dealing with those two problems at this exact moment or anything), the procedure is quite simple:

<pre><code>
# Get to the hidden .git directory within your project.
cd /path/to/your/project
cd .git/info
# in .git/info is a file named "exclude". Open it in whatever you like. Here we'll open it with Textmate.
mate exclude
</code></pre>

The file&#8217;s contents are, by default, commented out. To add your own ignore rules, just add each rule on a new line. Here&#8217;s a simple example from a Python project which prevents bytecode and Textmate project files from being committed:

<pre><code>
*.pyc
*.tmproj
</code></pre>

In a Rails project, you&#8217;d likely want a set of rules like the following <em>completely untested</em> fragment:

<pre><code>
log
*.log
*.pid
tmp
</code></pre>
