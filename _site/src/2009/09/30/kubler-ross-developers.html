<p>The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kübler-Ross_model'>Kübler-Ross</a> model is a classic pattern that defines how people deal with great loss or catastrophe. It&#8217;s the five-stage grief model so beloved by TV scriptwriters - <a href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveStagesOfGrief'>an array of shows</a> have made use of the model, most notably <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Fish,_Two_Fish,_Blowfish,_Blue_Fish'>this brilliant episode of The Simpsons</a> in which Homer learns of his own impending demise:</p>
<blockquote>
Hibbert: There are five stages. First is denial.<br />
Homer: No way, because I'm not dying.<br />
Hibbert: Next comes anger.<br />
Homer: Why you little...<br />
Hibbert: After that comes fear.<br />
Homer: What's after fear? What's after fear?<br />
Hibbert: Bargaining.<br />
Homer: Doc, you've got to get me out of this. I'll make it worth your while.<br />
Hibbert: And finally, comes acceptance.<br />
Homer: Well, we've all got to go sometime.<br />
Hibbert: Mr. Simpson, your progress is remarkable!

<p>It only occurred to me recently that the same model applies to a developer being told that his work has a bug. Not just a simple display bug, but one of those really nasty voodoo buggers that defy all attempts at rational explanation and turn debugging into a two-day stretch of swearing, shouting, and occult sacrifices. Observe:</p>

<h2 id='denial'>Denial</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Nah, that works just fine. Must be a freak happenstance, or the user&#8217;s machine is knackered.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id='anger'>Anger</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do people bring me all these problems? Give the users better training!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id='bargaining'>Bargaining</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe we can just fix it in the next version, so I can get on with my life?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id='depression'>Depression</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>This problem will never go away. It&#8217;s going to actually haunt me until I die. I am Moby Dick to this bug&#8217;s Ahab.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id='acceptance'>Acceptance</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>If I fix this, I can have my life back.</p>
