<p>When apple announced the iPhone OS&#8217; new capability to provide a tethered cellular data connection to your laptop, the masses rejoiced. When some carriers announced hefty additional charges for the privilege of using your &#8216;unlimited&#8217; data plan on a larger screen that you already own, the masses wept. It was as if a great many voices cried out and then were suddenly compelled to create a <a href='http://twitter.com/#search?q=o2fail'>new trending topic</a> on Twitter.</p>

<p>The problem, it seems, is that O2 promise to give you unlimited<sup>1</sup> use of your iPhone&#8217;s data connection, on condition that you do not take them up on the offer<sup>2</sup>. The deal as they see it is that you can consume a reasonable amount of data on your iPhone itself, but if you want to view that data on a big screen - say, a laptop you already own - it&#8217;ll cost you another £13 per month for the privilege. For those playing along at home, that&#8217;s the same price as a standard O2 USB modem plan, only they don&#8217;t give you the modem.</p>

<p>Therein lies the obvious question. Why does it cost more to download a reasonable amount of data to my laptop than to my telephone, especially when the difference between the two is rapidly thinning?</p>

<p>For those who feel that being charged £13/mo to deliver data over the final inch between your phone and your laptop is an insulting proposition, you know have another option. <a href='http://help.benm.at'>One brave soul</a> has created a small web application that provides tethering configuration for almost any carrier, enabling iPhone tethering without forcing you to buy a costly data plan in addition to the one already included your standard iPhone contract.</p>

<p>For those who choose this path, there are a few immediately obvious ways to profile a user&#8217;s connection to determine whether or not they&#8217;re tethering, so be mindful:</p>

<ol>
<li>If your user agent string is anything other than Mobile Safari, then you&#8217;re tethering.</li>

<li>If you&#8217;re loading Flash movies, then you&#8217;re tethering.</li>

<li>If you&#8217;re loading Java applets, then you&#8217;re tethering.</li>
</ol>

<p>Whether or not the operators will act on this finding is unknown.</p>

<p>Disclosure: I already hold a data contract with O2 and don&#8217;t plan on getting rid of it, as I find the USB modem very useful.</p>
