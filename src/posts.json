Many users note confusion around the purpose of some icons, most notably between search and zoom. It seems that some users expect magnifying glass icons to either increase the current zoom level, or to reset the zoom level to a full-page view. This is unfortunate, because the magnifying glass is, on the desktop, the canonical icon for search - so I’m curious to see if these results are specific to user interfaces that are so centered around zoom and pan, or if we’ve been missing problems with desktop iconography all along.
