<p>Hi there, sorry I haven&#8217;t written in a while. It&#8217;s this damned work business. Some actual content is promised soon.</p>

<p>Anyhow - A rather nasty text-escaping bug popped up in Chirrup, so I&#8217;ve issued a patch in version 0.81 which is <a href="http://chirrup.angryamoeba.co.uk">available for download</a> now.</p>

<p>The problem: Badly-formatted tweets containing certain special characters caused Chirrup&#8217;s JSON to fail parsing and the Chirrup UI to not display.</p>

<p>The fix: Improved sanitisation routine for tweet data being sent over JSON.</p>

<p>Happy Tweeting.</p>
